# Precise Timing

Abstractions for time management (measuring and inserting delays) that call high precision system calls, specific for each supported platform:

- Windows
- Linux
- Real-time Linux with [Xenomai]()

### Building

Compiling this requires linking to the corresponding system's time libraries

### Documentation

Descriptions of how the functions and data structures work are available at the [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)-generated [documentation pages](https://eesc-mkgroup.github.io/Precise-Timing/timing_8h.html)
